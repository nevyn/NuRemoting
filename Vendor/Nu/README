INTRODUCTION

Hello and welcome to Nu.

I created Nu because I wanted a better way to write software.

I wanted to write with a language as flexible and powerful as Lisp, but I 
also wanted to be able to work with the many libraries and high-performance
subsystems written in C, including the ones that I write myself.  So a tight 
integration with C was my highest priority; that ruled and drove the 
implementation of Nu.  That's why Nu is "C over lambda."

It is easier to integrate with C when you have a disciplined way of structuring 
C code.  Popular scripting languages (Python, Ruby, Lua, etc.) make many 
implementation-dependent impositions on the C code that they call.  Their
artifacts are often called "glue code" and are usually ugly, cumbersome, and 
unpleasant to generate.

Objective-C provides a proven way of structuring C code that has no scripting 
language implementation dependencies.  But it can do much more than that.
Objective-C can also serve as a platform for a powerful dynamic language.  
Nu was designed to take full advantage of that.  It was also designed to 
provide many of the elements of successful scripting languages, notably 
Ruby, while adding the syntactic simplicity and flexibility of Lisp.
